          `For ${cityName} drivers, peak dispatch demand correlates with weather. First hard freeze brings a wave of jump-start calls. First snowstorm brings winch-outs. Hot summer afternoons bring tire blowouts. Knowing the patterns helps you anticipate slightly longer response times during peaks.`,
          `Same-day roadside is the standard mode in ${cityName} — call us at ${PHONE} and the closest available technician is dispatched immediately. Average response time in ${cityName} is under 60 minutes for the cities we serve. The dispatcher gives you a real ETA based on the nearest tech's current location.`,

        heading: `Why Pay-As-You-Go Beats Auto-Club Memberships in ${cityName}`,
        paragraphs: [
          `Auto-club memberships in ${cityName} cost $80–$120 a year for basic coverage. Most members use the service zero or one time per year. The math: a member who needs roadside help once every two years pays $200 over those two years (two annual fees). Our pay-as-you-go model costs $100 for the same call. The savings keep compounding the rarer your usage.`,
          `Beyond the price comparison, our service in ${cityName} has practical advantages: a real human dispatcher answers the first ring (no phone tree), the average response is under 60 minutes, there's no annual call limit, no service exclusions for motorcycles or RVs, and the same flat $100/hr rate applies overnights, weekends, and holidays — no surcharges, ever.`,
          `Auto-club memberships make sense for ${cityName} drivers who break down 3+ times a year and pick a tier that includes those calls without overage fees. For everyone else, pay-as-you-go wins on price, response time, and operational simplicity.`,

      {
        heading: `Complete Guide to Jump-Start Service in ${cityName}`,
        paragraphs: [
          `Jump-starts are the most common roadside call in ${cityName}, especially during ${profile.region === "northeast" || profile.region === "midwest" ? "winter cold snaps" : profile.region === "southwest" ? "summer heat waves" : "weather extremes"}. Our technicians use commercial-grade jump packs (not consumer cables) that protect modern vehicle electronics. After the jump, they run a voltage check on the alternator and a load test on the battery to tell you whether the issue was a one-time drain or a battery on its last legs.`,
          `If the test indicates a failing battery, you have two options: drive directly to an auto-parts store while the engine's running (don't shut it off), or have us replace the battery on-site. We carry common Group 24, 35, 48, 65, and 78 batteries for most American and import vehicles. On-site replacement takes 15–25 minutes including disposal of the old battery (which we recycle at no cost).`,
          `For ${cityName} drivers who have had to jump-start their vehicle twice in the past 30 days, that's a pattern — the battery is on its way out. Replace it before it strands you somewhere worse than your own driveway. The cost of a new battery installed on-site is typically $150–$280 depending on size (battery at retail price, plus 15–25 minutes of install time at the standard flat $100/hr rate).`,

        heading: `Flat Tire Service in ${cityName} — Spare Swap vs. On-Site Plug`,
        paragraphs: [
          `When we arrive at a flat tire call in ${cityName}, the technician finds the leak first. If the leak is in the tread (the flat surface of the tire), most punctures can be plug-sealed on-site with a vulcanized plug kit. The plug holds for the remaining service life of the tire. Total time: 25–40 minutes including inflation to spec.`,
          `If the leak is in the sidewall (the vertical surface), plug-sealing isn't safe — the sidewall flexes constantly while driving and any plug will eventually fail at speed. In that case, we mount the spare and refer you to a tire shop for replacement.`,
          `Locking lug nuts are a common surprise in ${cityName}. If your wheels have locking lugs, you need the matching key (usually in the glove box or trunk) to remove them. If you've lost the key, our techs carry a set of common removal sockets that handle most locking lug designs. If those don't work, the lug must be cut off — adds 20–30 minutes to the call but is fixable.`,
          `Spare tire types matter: a full-size spare is interchangeable with your regular tires and you can drive on it indefinitely. A temporary spare ('donut') is rated for 50 miles maximum at 50 MPH or less. Many modern vehicles have no spare at all and rely on run-flat tires or a sealant/compressor kit — if there's no usable spare, we recommend a flatbed tow.`,

      {
        heading: `Car Lockout Service in ${cityName} — No-Damage Entry`,
        paragraphs: [
          `Car lockouts in ${cityName} are common and entirely fixable without damaging your vehicle. We use professional wedge-and-rod tools rated for modern vehicles — no slim jims that damage power window components, no coat hangers that scratch interior panels. The process takes 5–15 minutes for most makes and models.`,
          `For trunk lockouts in ${cityName}, glove box lockouts, and lockouts where the keys are visible inside the vehicle but you have no spare, the same wedge-and-rod approach works. For dead key fob batteries, we keep common CR2032 and CR2025 cells on the truck.`,
          `We require ID confirming you're the vehicle owner or authorized driver before opening any locked vehicle — standard procedure to protect ${cityName} vehicle owners from unauthorized entry. Photo ID matching the registration, or registration plus a photo of you with the vehicle, is sufficient.`,
          `For ${cityName} residents who have lost their keys entirely (not just locked them inside), that's a different job — you need a locksmith with key-cutting and transponder programming capability. This is usually a dealership service, not a roadside service. We can tow you to the dealership.`,

        heading: `Fuel Delivery Service in ${cityName}`,

          `Running out of gas in ${cityName} is one of those things that happens to almost every driver eventually. We deliver 2–5 gallons of approved gasoline or diesel in proper containers and pour it into your tank. Total on-scene time is usually 15–25 minutes, including the time it takes the fuel pump to draw the fresh gas through the lines and the engine to crank back to life.`,
          `Cost structure: the fuel itself is billed at local pump price plus the standard service call rate ($100/hr with 1-hour minimum). There's no inflated 'emergency fuel' markup. If gas costs $3.50/gallon at a ${cityName} station, you pay $3.50/gallon for the fuel we deliver. The labor portion is the same flat rate as any other roadside call.`,
          `Diesel-specific note: after running a diesel dry, the engine often needs the fuel system to be manually bled to remove air. Most modern diesels have an electric auxiliary pump that does this automatically when you cycle the key without cranking, but some older diesels and commercial trucks require a hand pump and a bleed screw. Our diesel-trained ${cityName} techs carry the necessary tools.`,

          `Tow vehicle types: flatbed trucks for AWD/4WD vehicles, low-clearance cars, and any vehicle that shouldn't be wheel-lifted. Standard wheel-lift towing for most front- or rear-wheel-drive sedans. Local tows in the ${cityName} area are billed at the flat $100/hr rate plus per-mile charges past a 5-mile included distance. Long-distance towing is available with a separate quote.`,
          `For accident scenes in ${cityName}, our techs coordinate with police on scene, document vehicle condition for insurance, and tow to the shop or impound lot of your choice.

          `Stuck in ${cityName}? It happens — snow drift in winter, soft shoulder after rain, mud on a backroad, a parking attempt that didn't end where you expected. Our recovery trucks carry heavy-duty winches rated for full-size SUVs and pickups, with proper rigging (tow straps with soft shackles, snatch blocks for tight angles, tree-saver straps if a winch point isn't available on the vehicle).`,
          `Most ${cityName} winch-outs are completed in 20–45 minutes. The cost is the same flat $100/hr — no special "recovery fee" or "off-road surcharge." If the situation requires more than the standard tools (a deeply buried vehicle, a vehicle off a steep embankment), the tech will quote the additional time before continuing.`,
          `We don't perform true off-road recovery in genuine off-pavement scenarios — that's a specialist 4x4 recovery job. For everything roadside-adjacent (soft shoulders, snowbanks, ditches, mud, sand), we've got the equipment and training.`,

          `We stock common Group 24, 35, 48, 65, and 78 batteries on every service truck. These cover the vast majority of American and import vehicles sold in ${cityName}. The new battery is billed at retail price (no markup beyond what the parts store would charge you) plus our service rate. Old battery recycled at no additional cost.`,
          `Most installs in ${cityName} take 15–25 minutes. The tech disconnects the old battery in the right sequence (negative first to prevent shorts), removes any hold-down hardware, installs the new battery, cleans terminals, applies anti-corrosion compound on terminals (especially valuable in ${profile.region === "northeast" || profile.region === "midwest" ?

Jump-starting requires care because small bike batteries are easily damaged by improper jumps. We dispatch motorcycle-trained technicians for every motorcycle call — never standard auto techs.`,
          `For ${cityName} motorcycle riders, the most common roadside calls are dead batteries (sport bikes especially are sensitive to short trips and parasitic draws), flat tires (which usually require pulling the wheel — shop work, but we can deliver fuel and tow to the nearest motorcycle shop), and fuel delivery for riders who ran tank-dry farther from a station than they expected.`,

        paragraphs: [
          `Modern vehicles often won't unlock — or in some cases won't start — when the key fob battery dies, even if a physical key is hidden inside the fob. The fix is a $5 battery and a five-minute procedure. The value is in not having to wait for a dealership service appointment tomorrow.`,
          `Our ${cityName} techs carry CR2032, CR2025, CR2450, and a handful of other common cells, plus the small Torx and Philips drivers needed to open most fob shells without breaking the clips. After replacing the battery, the tech confirms the fob communicates with the vehicle by locking, unlocking, and starting the vehicle.`,
          `Some luxury vehicles in ${cityName} (BMW, Audi, Mercedes) have flush-mount or proximity-only fobs that require dealer programming after a battery change. For those, we'll do the battery and confirm if the fob works — if it requires dealer programming, we'll let you know upfront.`,

        paragraphs: [
          `${cityName} fleets — delivery vans, service trucks, sales fleets, rental cars, dealership lots — have ongoing roadside needs that retail pricing doesn't always fit cleanly. We offer fleet accounts with consolidated monthly billing (one invoice per month, line-item per call), dedicated dispatch lines (no general phone queue, faster routing), and consistent technician assignments where geography allows.`,
          `The rate per call is the same flat $100/hr as retail. Volume doesn't get a discounted rate — that's how we keep pricing transparent. What fleet accounts get is operational support: clean documentation for accounting and insurance, real-time visibility into every call, breakdown patterns by vehicle and route, and a single point of contact for invoicing.`,
          `${cityName} fleet customers also benefit from priority dispatch during routine demand and surge planning during weather events. If a snowstorm or heat wave is going to spike call volume, fleet customers know about it ahead of time and can plan accordingly.`,

        heading: `What to Do When You Break Down in ${cityName} — First Five Minutes`,
        paragraphs: [
          `The first five minutes after a breakdown in ${cityName} matter more than the next hour of waiting. Step one: get off the road if you can. Coast to a shoulder, off-ramp, or parking lot. The difference between a vehicle in a travel lane and a vehicle on a shoulder is the difference between high-risk and routine.`,
          `Step two: engage hazards and stabilize the vehicle. Hazard lights on immediately. If you have road triangles or LED warning lights, deploy them 50–100 feet behind the vehicle. Park, set the parking brake, and turn the wheels away from traffic.`,
          `Step three: decide whether to stay in the vehicle or exit. On a high-speed ${cityName} highway with no shoulder, staying buckled inside is usually safer than standing beside it. On a wide shoulder or low-speed road, exiting on the side facing away from traffic is usually safer.`,
          `Step four: locate yourself precisely. Open your maps app and screenshot your current location. Note the nearest mile marker, exit number, or cross street. The dispatcher needs precise location to send help.`,
          `Step five: call. Have ready: your exact location in ${cityName}, vehicle year/make/model, the nature of the problem, and any safety concerns. The dispatcher will ask all of these — having them ready makes the call 2 minutes instead of 8. Our number: ${PHONE}.`,

Passenger cars, light and medium-duty trucks (gas and diesel), motorcycles (motorcycle-trained techs only), RVs and travel trailers (Class A, B, C), and most commercial vehicles.

          `${cityName} drivers have multiple options for roadside service — auto clubs, dealership programs, independent tow companies, and us. The deciding factors are usually price, response time, and trust. We compete on all three: flat $100/hr (no annual dues), average under 60-minute response, and licensed/bonded/insured technicians.`,
          `Our ${cityName} technicians are background-checked before joining the network, trained in safe roadside procedures, and equipped with commercial-grade tools. Every service vehicle is liability-insured. If your vehicle is damaged during a service call, our insurance covers the repair at no cost to you.`,
          `24/7 dispatch with the same flat rate. No memberships, no contracts, no per-mile trip fees. Just a real dispatcher, a fast tech, and a fair price. Call ${PHONE} when you need help in ${cityName}.`,
