Most ${stateAbbr} drivers pay $80–$120 per year for a roadside membership and never use it, then still wait two or three hours when they actually need help. We flipped that model. Pay when you need us, never when you don't.`,

We handle ${sc} specialized roadside services and operate across ${cities.length} cities in ${stateName}.`,
          `Our mission is simple: get you back on the road fast, charge a predictable rate, and never sell you something you didn't need.

          `Step 2 — The technician calls you with an arrival estimate. You'll also get a text with their name, photo, and ETA. Average response time in the ${stateAbbr} cities we serve is under 60 minutes.`,
          `Step 3 — On arrival, the tech confirms the situation, walks you through what they're about to do, and gets to work. For roadside calls on highways, they position the service vehicle to shield you from traffic, deploy cones, and put on a reflective vest before starting.`,
          `Step 4 — Once the issue is resolved, you get a digital invoice on your phone with the total time worked, the flat-rate cost, and a payment link. All major cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, Zelle, CashApp, or cash. A receipt goes straight to your email for expense reports, insurance, or rideshare records.`,
          `If the roadside fix isn't enough — a vehicle with a more serious issue — the technician will tell you on the spot, quote a tow to a shop, and get it done. We don't disappear once we discover a roadside fix won't work.`,

          `Fuel and recovery covers out-of-gas delivery (gasoline or diesel, 2–5 gallons at pump price plus the service rate), local towing (flatbed for AWD/4WD or low-clearance vehicles, wheel-lift for standard sedans), and winch-out recovery for vehicles stuck in mud, snow, sand, or ditches.`,

Traditional clubs collect $80–$120 a year, gate service behind 3–4 calls, and still keep you waiting two or three hours when something breaks. We charge only when you need us, dispatch 24/7, and the average response in ${stateAbbr} is under an hour.`,
          `The pricing is transparent: $100 per hour, 1-hour minimum, same rate at every hour of every day. Tow mileage past 5 miles, replacement parts (like a new battery), and fuel are billed separately at cost — exactly what the gas station or parts supplier charges, nothing inflated.`,

A jump-start that takes 20 minutes still bills at the 1-hour minimum — that's the deal. If the situation is more complex — a stuck wheel lug, a vehicle deep in soft ground, a difficult lockout — additional time is quoted before continuing.`,
