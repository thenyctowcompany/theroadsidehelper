    // INTRO
    `${ct.name} across America are tired of paying for auto-club memberships they barely use. Most members pay $80–$120 a year, hit the 3- or 4-call limit before extras kick in, and still wait two or three hours when something actually breaks. The Roadside Helper was built specifically for ${ct.name.toLowerCase()} who want a different deal: pay only when you need us, no contracts, dispatch 24/7, and a flat rate that doesn't change at 3am or on Christmas.`,

    // OUR MODEL
    `Our model is straightforward. One flat rate — $100 per hour with a 1-hour minimum — covers a real, trained roadside technician, commercial-grade equipment, and the time to fix the problem. Most roadside calls finish inside the 1-hour minimum, which means the minimum is also the maximum for the typical job. Tow mileage past 5 miles, replacement parts (like a new battery), and fuel are billed separately at actual market cost — nothing inflated.`,

    // SPECIFIC TO THIS CUSTOMER TYPE
    `For ${ct.name.toLowerCase()} specifically, the model fits the situation. ${ct.longDescription} Average response time in the cities we serve is under 60 minutes. The dispatcher gives you a real ETA based on the nearest available technician's current location — not a vague "someone will be there eventually" estimate.`,

    // PAIN POINTS
    `We understand the specific challenges ${ct.name.toLowerCase()} face on the road. ${ct.painPoints[0]}? Priority dispatch and a real human dispatcher on the first ring. ${ct.painPoints[1]}? That's why we built 24/7 service with no surcharge for overnight, weekends, or holidays. ${ct.painPoints[2] || "Whatever your specific situation"} — our trained technicians have handled it before, today, this week. ${ct.painPoints[3] ? ct.painPoints[3] + "? We have a specific process for that too." : ""}`,

    // VALUE HIGHLIGHTS
    `What we deliver for ${ct.name.toLowerCase()}: ${ct.creditHighlights[0]}. ${ct.creditHighlights[1]}. ${ct.creditHighlights[2] || "And the rate stays the same regardless of when you call"}. The dispatcher quotes you the rate before the technician rolls. The technician confirms the rate on arrival. Nothing is added to your bill that wasn't agreed to first. If the situation turns out to be more complex than typical, you're told the additional time before any extra work starts.`,

    // SERVICES RECOMMENDED
    `For ${ct.name.toLowerCase()}, the most common services we dispatch are: ${relatedServices.map((s) => s.title).join(", ")}. Each service uses the same flat $100/hr rate. The technician dispatched to your call is trained specifically for that service type — motorcycle calls go to motorcycle-trained techs, diesel calls go to diesel-trained techs, RV calls go to RV-trained techs. You're never sent a generalist for a specialty job.`,

    // NATIONWIDE + LOCAL
    `We operate in over 900 cities across all 50 states. Whether you're a ${ct.name.toLowerCase().replace(/s$/, "")} stranded on a New York highway, in a suburban Dallas parking lot, or on a rural Vermont back road — our network has a qualified technician within dispatch range. Local technicians know the area: which interchanges are safe to pull off on, which shoulders have decent cell signal, which exits lead to nearby shops if a tow is needed.`,

    // SCHEDULING / DISPATCH
    `Dispatch for ${ct.name.toLowerCase()} works around the clock. We operate 24/7, 365 days a year — overnights, weekends, holidays at the same flat rate. Most calls are unplanned (you don't schedule a dead battery), so dispatch is reactive and fast. For planned roadside service (a known-failing battery, a fuel delivery for a parked vehicle, a scheduled winch-out on private property), you can book a specific time window through the booking page. Same flat rate, no surcharge for scheduling.`,

    // SAFETY + INSURANCE
    `Every technician on our network is background-checked before joining, trained in safe roadside procedures, and certified to use commercial-grade equipment. For highway-side work, technicians wear ANSI-compliant high-visibility gear, deploy cones, and position the service vehicle to shield the customer from traffic before any work begins. Every service vehicle is liability-insured. If your vehicle is damaged during a roadside call — a scratched rim during a tire change, a scuffed bumper during a tow hookup — our insurance covers the repair at no cost to you.`,

    // BOTTOM LINE
    `The bottom line for ${ct.name.toLowerCase()}: pay only when you need roadside help, get a fast dispatch, and pay a predictable flat rate. No annual dues, no membership contract, no 3-hour wait, no after-hours surcharge. Call ${PHONE} when you need us. The dispatcher will give you a real ETA and the technician will get you back on the road.`,
