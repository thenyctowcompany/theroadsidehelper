            <p>As a roadside technician, you'll be dispatched to drivers who need help — jump-starts, tire changes, lockouts, fuel delivery, towing, and winch-outs. You'll work from a service vehicle equipped with commercial-grade tools, follow proper safety procedures for highway-side work, and get drivers moving again as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>This is a physical, hands-on job. You'll be lifting, kneeling, working around traffic, dealing with weather, and handling stressful situations professionally. It's also a skilled job — knowing the difference between a one-time battery drain and a failing battery, knowing which lockout tools fit which makes, knowing when a flat tire can be plugged vs. when it needs the spare. We train on all of it.</p>

            <p>The roadside industry has a reputation for high turnover and stressful work. We've structured the job to fix the worst parts. Flat-rate billing means you're not chasing volume or pressured to upsell — you fix the problem, document it, and move to the next call. Honest pricing means customers are usually relieved to see us, not braced for a fight.</p>
            <p>You work from a properly-equipped service vehicle (not your own car), the dispatch system gives you full information about each call before you arrive, and the company handles billing — you handle the service work. Real human dispatchers means you're not arguing with an automated system when something unexpected comes up.</p>
            <p>We're growing fast across {STATE_COUNT} states. That growth creates real opportunities — new market launches, new shift lead roles, new operations positions. If you want a roadside job that doesn't burn you out by year two, this is the place.</p>

            <p><strong>Shift start:</strong> Report to dispatch base or sign in remotely from your service vehicle. Review any active dispatch queue. Confirm equipment inventory on the truck.</p>
            <p><strong>Active dispatch:</strong> Calls route to you based on proximity. Each call comes with full info — customer name, location, vehicle make/model, problem description. You call the customer with your ETA before driving, then head out.</p>
            <p><strong>On scene:</strong> Confirm safety, walk the customer through what you're about to do, perform the service, document the work, collect payment via tablet. Typical call: 30–60 minutes door-to-door including drive time.</p>
            <p><strong>Between calls:</strong> Restock if needed, return to coverage zone, take meal breaks. Most technicians handle 4–8 calls per shift depending on geography and call mix.</p>
            <p><strong>End of shift:</strong> Return to base, sign off, log any equipment that needs replenishing for the next shift. Daily summary auto-generated.</p>
